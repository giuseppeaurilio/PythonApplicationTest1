Some comments to my solution:
0. solution was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 IDE for my convenience.

1. function initializeCountriesStructure is really slow. The bottleneck is the call to the service https://api.hungermapdata.org/swe-notifications/region/{region_id}/country. 
To increase performance, it can be  executed just at start up, but in this way data changes on CSV files are not considered until next application restart.
In alternative, an yearly check can be implemented.

2. initializeCountriesStructure function can be optimized with the use of API https://api.hungermapdata.org/swe-notifications/country/{country_id}/regions, 
but at the present moment i can't get a properly working solution.

3.In the fili INI, if the parameter testMode = False, some mock data are considered: 
Mock data are part  of the solution, and the section [TESTMODE] of the file ini has parameters to use them

Unit tests (test.py) use this mock files and need testMode = True in the ini file; following the expected results of unit tests:
country: 1, regioncount: 3, totpop: 60  
country: 2, regioncount: 3, totpop: 150  
country: 3, regioncount: 2, totpop: 150  
country: 4, regioncount: 1, totpop: 90 
country: 16, regioncount: 1, totpop: 0 

country: 1; d0: 30; d30: 10; var: +33.33; -> WARNING
country: 2; d0: 30; d30: 50; var: -13.33; -> OK
country: 3; d0: 20; d30: 15; var: +3.33; -> OK
country: 4; d0: 10; d30: 12 ; var: -2.22; -> OK
country: 16; d0: 0; d30: 0; var:0; -> OK

5.The checkFoodSecurity function runs periodically, based on the parameter runtimesecondsinterval in the file ini.

6. email addresses are stored in txt file via json data. 
These info can be moved to other media such as DB. 
The folder containing txt files can be configured from INI file, property emailaddressespath

7. the code for sending email is commented (CountryController.py line 106)

Other known possible improvements:
application error are not managed. 
error communication with API are not managed
SMTP usernameand password must not be stored in ini file
apiservices URI can be moved to a configuration file.
